Shenzhou 12 was originally planned as the second visiting mission for the experimental Tiangong-2 space station, following Shenzhou 11. In 2016, plans for a second mission to Tiangong-2 were cancelled, and Shenzhou 12 was replanned as the first crewed Shenzhou mission to the Tiangong space station which currently consists of one module, Tianhe, launched on 29 April 2021.[6] The flight will mark the first of four crewed missions, by the end of construction in 2022.[5]
The spacecraft was launched on a Long March-2F rocket in China's Gobi Desert on 17 June 2021.[4] After about six-and-a-half hours flight it arrived at Chinese space station Tiangong.[7] The mission docked with the Tianhe core module at 07:54 UTC, 17 June 2021, following the launch and successful docking of Tianzhou 2, the second flight of China's Tianzhou cargo resupply craft. Tianzhou 2 was able to remain docked, because the Tianhe core module has four docking ports, unlike China's two previous space stations which only had one.[8]
The crew entered the Tianhe core module later at 10:48 UTC, marking the first time taikonauts have entered the Tiangong space station.[1] They will carry out tasks such as the mechanical arm operation and extravehicular activities, and verify a series of key technologies such as long-term residence in space, recycling of resources and life support of astronauts.[9] Two spacewalks are planned to occur during the crew's approximately three-month stay in orbit.[1] Shenzhou 13 will be in standby for an possible rescue mission.[10]
